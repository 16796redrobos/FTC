goal:
  - Attach the linear slide to the robot
  - Work on the logbook
description:
  Our primary focus today was attaching a linear slide to the robot. We worked collaboratively to ensure proper alignment and tightening. In addition to the linear slide, we dedicated time to maintaining the logbook. This included updating the logbook with details about their progress and any encountered challenges or issues. 
reflection:
  We made considerable progress in both attaching the linear slide to the robot and keeping the logbook current.
