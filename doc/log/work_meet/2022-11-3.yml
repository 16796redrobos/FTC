reflection: |
  It is with regret that we must report that we were unable to work in an efficient manner and successfully achieve our goal. This was due in part to issues with the camera hardware, which did not function properly. Additionally, the model architecture and expected output were not specified in the relevant documentation, rendering us unable to train with our own data. Furthermore, a lack of efficiency among team members also contributed to our inability to meet our goal.
